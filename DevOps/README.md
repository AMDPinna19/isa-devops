## Deliverables

### Mutation Testing

You must deliver a PDF file at the root of your `main` repository on Mjøllnir, named `mutants.pdf`. There is no page limit but _concision_ is an evaluation criteria (and your report should be ~3 pages long).

It must contain the following description:

  - What are your directory structure and language/script choices;
  - How are mutators compiled and applied to your target project;
  - Which mutation did you write, and why?;
  - What issues did you run into, and how did you solve them?;
  - What characterizes good mutators?;
  - What did you learn?

Moreover, your code and scripts in your repository(ies) must be tagged with `mutant_delivery`. Please specify the list of repositories to include if you deliver several.
