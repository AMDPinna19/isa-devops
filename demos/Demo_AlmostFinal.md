## Expectations

You have to demonstrate a single product, covering both ISA & DevOps course contents. This single demo will be evaluated according to these two dimensions, leading to two different marks. *However*, the two courses expect the project to respect the _PolyEvent_ call for bids and implement features related to this project.

For ISA, the keypoint is to demonstrate a comprehensive architecture, going from the persistence layer to the exposition one (_i.e._, web services, JSF). You must be able to defend a strength of your architecture, as well as discuss its limitations and evolution capabilities.

For DevOps, the keypoint is to ...


For both demonstration, think to also demonstrate error cases (e.g., third party service unavailable, network lost, broken test, corrupted JAR, ...) instead of staying in a perfect world. You must also clearly identify who did what (for both topics) in the project development.
